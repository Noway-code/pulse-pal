Every second for a doctor matters. We save time, increase efficiency, and direct the doctor to key areas of focus for patients. We use an innovative measurement technique to maximize patient comfort.

Our app revolutionizes healthcare by streamlining patient record management and pre-visit screening, significantly boosting efficiency and diagnostic precision. Here's how it benefits both doctors and patients:

### For Healthcare Providers:
- **Time-Saving:** Automates compiling fragmented medical records, saving an average of 16 minutes per patient. This allows doctors to focus more on patient care rather than administrative tasks. It also summarizes radiology reports!
- **Pre-visit Screening:** Utilizes remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology for early detection of conditions like cardiovascular diseases by analyzing heart rate variability metrics. This screening ensures doctors can prioritize patients based on urgency and have critical health insights before the consultation begins.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot:** Designed for doctors, this feature collects patient symptoms and inquiries beforehand, enabling informed decision-making and more personalized care during consultations.

### For Patients:
- **Noninvasive Screening:** The app's use of rPPG technology offers a convenient, noninvasive way for patients to perform preliminary health checks, potentially identifying serious health issues early.
- **Dynamic Health Monitoring:** Enables patients to monitor changes in their health over time, alerting both them and their healthcare provider to any signs of deterioration for timely intervention.

### Impact:
- **Efficiency:** Reduces administrative workload for healthcare providers, allowing more time for patient care.
- **Early Detection:** Facilitates early detection of diseases, with heart rate variability being a key predictor for cardiovascular conditions.
- **Improved Care:** Enhances the quality of doctor-patient interactions by ensuring consultations are informed and focused on care.

This digital health solution not only makes healthcare more efficient and safer but also promotes proactive health management, leading to better outcomes for patients.
